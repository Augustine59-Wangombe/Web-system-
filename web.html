<p class="P1">Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications that run on the internet. It involves a combination of programming, design, and problem-solving to build platforms that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. A web developer works with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design interfaces users can interact with, as well as back-end technologies such as databases, servers, and frameworks to handle the logic and data processing behind the scenes. With the rapid growth of online businesses, social platforms, and digital services, web development has become an essential skill for creating solutions that connect people, share information, and drive innovation in today’s digital world.</p>
